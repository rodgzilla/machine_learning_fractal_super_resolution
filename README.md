# Fractal super-resolution

The goal of this project is to increase the resolution of Mandelbrot
set fractal pictures using a residual super-resolution neural network.

Using the trained network, we can choose a subsection of a fractal
images and ask the network to increase its resolution, effectively
zooming on it. This idea can be used to produce zooming videos only
using what the neural network understands of the Mandelbrot set and
no mathematics related to fractal geometry.
